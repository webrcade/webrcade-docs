Although, the Internet Archive does provide its own search mechanism, Google typically provides faster and more accurate search results.To limit the Google search to the Internet Archive, add \"<code>site:archive.org</code>\" after your search criteria (see screenshot below).In the example shown below, the full search text is as follows:<code>retro pie homebrew site:archive.org</code></li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Click on one of the search results to navigate to the corresponding Internet Archive page (see screenshot below).</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>If the Internet Archive page contains downloadable files, a content box titled, \"<code>DOWNLOAD OPTIONS</code>\" should appear on the right side of the page (the page may need to be scrolled to make the content box visible).Click the \"<code>SHOW ALL</code>\" link in the context box to view all of the downloadable files (see screenshot below).</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Click on the \"<code>View Contents</code>\" link to the right of the ISO file to view its contents (see screenshot below).It is extremely important to descend to the lowest possible level within an archive.

Using a link to the zip file (versus a specific ROM file) will result in much larger downloads with a non-deterministic ROM file being executed.</li> </ul>  <p>Note</p> <p>The Internet Archive supports descending into various archive file formats (.iso, .zip., etc.). However, It is important to note that although descending into archives may be supported, there exists a  bug for certain formats (.7z, etc.) that results in contained content being downloaded as zero bytes (which is unusable). An easy way to validate that a file will be downloaded correctly is to open the link to the file in a new tab. If the downloaded content file size is greater than zero, it is being downloaded correctly. </p>  <p></p> <ul> <li>Select a file within the ISO and copy its link address (See screenshot below).In this particular case, the link being copied is for the excellent NES homebrew game, \"Super Uwol!\" by the Mojon Twins.It is also worth noting that in this particular case, the Internet Archive did not provide an opportunity to descend into the .zip file (a \"<code>View Contents</code>\" link was not provided, which would have been preferable).</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>At this point, the copied URL which refers to the Super Uwol!
