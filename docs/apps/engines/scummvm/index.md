## Overview

The [ScummVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScummVM) application plays classic graphical adventure and role-playing games.

The webЯcade ScummVM application is currently based on the 2.6.1 version of ScummVM. See the [Compatibility Page](https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/2.6.1/) hosted on the ScummVM site for details on which games are supported by this version of ScummVM.

Due to the size and variety of games supported by ScummVM, not all games are available across the supported webЯcade platforms. See the [webЯcade ScummVM Compatibility](./compatibility.md) page for full details.

### Touch Controls

WebЯcade supports two different touch control modes for webЯcade as described below.

This mode can be toggled via the "Toggle Touch Mode" button within the [On-screen controls](#on-screen-controls).

---

#### Touchpad Mode: <span style="color:#ee5755">Disabled</span>

When touchpad mode is *disabled*, the cursor will move directly to where the finger is tapped. While this mode can be fairly intuitive, it does have a tenancy to obstruct visibility to items that are beneath the finger. Additionally, it makes it difficult to navigate and click on the edges of the screen.

| __Gesture__ | __Description__ |
| --- | --- |
| Short single finger tap | Move pointer to finger position and left mouse button click |
| Short second finger tap while holding one finger | Move pointer to first finger position and right mouse button click |
| Single finger drag | Move pointer directly with finger |
| Two finger drag | <p>Move pointer while left mouse button is held down (drag and drop).</p><p>The pointer directly follows the first finger.</p><p>The drag is ended when the last finger is removed.</p>|
| Three finger drag | <p>Move pointer while right mouse button is held down (drag and drop).</p><p>The pointer directly follows the first finger.</p><p>The drag is ended when the last finger is removed.</p>|

---

#### Touchpad Mode: <span style="color:#4eae57">Enabled</span>

When touchpad mode is *enabled*, dragging the finger tends to act like using a touchpad on a laptop, etc. The mouse cursor is moved relative to the movement of the finger. While this mode may not be as initially intuitive, it does allow for increased visibility of the items that are being interacted with, and it is much simpler to navigate and click on the edges of the screen.

| __Gesture__ | __Description__ |
| --- | --- |
| Short single finger tap | Left mouse button click |
| Short second finger tap while holding one finger | Right mouse button click |
| Single finger drag | Move pointer indirectly with finger |
| Two finger drag | <p>Move pointer while left mouse button is held down (drag and drop).</p><p>The pointer motion is affected by the first finger.</p><p>The drag is ended when the last finger is removed.</p> |
| Three finger drag | <p>Move pointer while right mouse button is held down (drag and drop).</p><p>The pointer motion is affected by the first finger.</p><p>The drag is ended when the last finger is removed.</p> |

## Packaging Games

ScummVM games must be packaged as an archive (`.zip`) file for use with webЯcade. This archive file can also be *(optionally)* converted to a webЯcade [package archive manifest](../../../advanced/archive-manifests.md) (`.json`) layout to reduce browser memory use and increase compatibility with memory limited devices (iOS and Xbox).

!!! important
    The  webЯcade editor's [repackage archive tool](../../../editor/tools/repackage-archive.md) can be used
    to automatically generate package archive manifests.

Each ScummVM game has its own specific file layout requirements. One of the best ways to determine this layout is via the [ScummVM Wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games).

For example, [this ScummVM Wiki page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Flight_of_the_Amazon_Queen) details the structure necessary for the game, "Flight of the Amazon Queen" (see the *Installation* and *Required Data Files* sections).

!!! important
    For ScummVM game archive (`.zip`) sizes that are over 100 megabytes in size, it is highly recommended that the webЯcade [package archive manifest](../../../advanced/archive-manifests.md) (`.json`) layout be utilized. This will greatly
    reduce the amount of memory necessary for the browser to load the game, and increase
    compatibility with devices with higher memory use limitations (iOS and Xbox).

## Adding Games (Feed Editor)

Due to the variability of packaging ScummVM games, adding ScummVM-based games in the [Feed Editor](../../../editor/index.md) must be done manually (versus using auto-detection).

See the [Adding Disc and Archive-based Items](../../../editor/workspace/addingitems.md#disc-and-archive-based-items) section for details on adding ScummVM-based games in the [Feed Editor](../../../editor/index.md).

!!! important
    Both the Safari (iOS and macOS) and Xbox Series X|S Edge browsers limit the amount of memory that can be consumed by a particular web application (such as webЯcade).
    <p>
    On macOS, it is recommended that the Chrome Browser be utilized to increase the size of ScummVM games that can be loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
    To increase the likelihood of loading larger ScummVM games on iOS and Xbox you can optionally choose to launch the game using a standalone-based link (versus launching the game within the webЯcade player or editor). See the [Standalone](../../../standalone/index.md) section of this documentation for further information (On Xbox, you would most likely want to bookmark the direct link. On iOS, you would most likely want to add the game to the home screen).
    </p>

The options within the native ScummVM menu will vary based on the game being played. However, the menu will typically contain options for saving and loading the state of the current game, setting game-specific configuration options, etc.

## Saved Games

This application supports persisting game saves as well as game-specific settings into the browser's local storage or optionally to [cloud-based storage](../../../storage/index.md). Saved games can be loaded and resumed on subsequent gaming sessions.

## Feed

This section details how ScummVM application instances can be added to feeds.

### Type

The type name for the ScummVM application is `scummvm`.

!!! note
    The alias `scumm` also currently maps to this application. In the future, the `scumm` alias may be mapped
    to another ScummVM application (different engine implementation) if it is determined to be a
    more appropriate default.

### Properties

The table below contains the properties that are specific to the ScummVM application. These properties are
specified in the `props` object of a feed item.

| __Property__ | __Type__ | __Required__ | __Details__ |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| uid | String | Yes | <p>A unique identifier for the particular game (must be unique across all ScummVM games).</p><p>This identifier is primarily used to associate persistent state with the game.</p>|
| archive | URL | Yes | URL to a ScummMVM game archive (`.zip`) or webЯcade [package archive manifest](../../../advanced/archive-manifests.md) (`.json`) file. |
| zoomLevel | Numeric | No | A numeric value indicating how much the display image should be zoomed in (0-40). |

### Example

The following is an example of a complete feed that consists of a single ScummVM application instance (`type` value of `scumm`). The `archive` property value is a URL that points to a Dropbox location that contains a webЯcade [package archive manifest](../../../advanced/archive-manifests.md) file for the game, "Flight of the Amazon".

``` json hl_lines="9 12"
{
  "title": "ScummVM Feed",
  "categories": [
    {
      "title": "ScummVM Games",
      "items": [
        {
          "title": "Flight of the Amazon Queen",
          "type": "scumm",
          "props": {
            "uid": "5edb2784-1acb-42c1-beed-6470a546cad5",
            "archive": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/djrtdavrj5p5f2jvqitgx/WRC-MANIFEST.JSON?rlkey=gnvm8tvagr3urvdff1chvd4cs&dl=0"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This example can be tested by adding a feed with the following URL within the [webЯcade player](../../../userguide/index.md):

`http://tinyurl.com/sample-scumm-feed`
