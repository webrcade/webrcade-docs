# Applications

The table below contains the list of application categories that are currently supported by webЯcade. 

All items (games, etc.) that are "launched" (played, etc.) from the webЯcade front-end rely on the use of an associated *application*. For example, playing an SNES homebrew game utilizes the [Super Nintendo Application](../apps/emulators/snes/index.md) (emulator).

Clicking on the name of a *Category* in the table will navigate to a page containing the collection of applications within the category.

| __Category__ | __Description__ |

| [Emulators](./emulators/index.md) | The collection of emulators (Atari, Nintendo, Sega, etc.) supported by webЯcade |
| [Engines](./engines/index.md) | The collection of game engines (Classic Doom, etc.) supported by webЯcade |
